# Unbabel Java Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Java Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

**Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge.** We will evaluate the code on the fork.

**FYI:** Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/jobs). There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

## Challenge
